The three-way head-to-head table shows: Elche (1st, 7 pts: 2W-1D-1L), Huesca (2nd, 6 pts: 1W-2D-1L), Eibar (3rd, 2 pts: 0W-2D-2L). Therefore, Elche would survive, Huesca would be relegated (18th), and Eibar would also be relegated. The key insight is that two-way tiebreakers can flip when a third team is introduced - Huesca beats Elche head-to-head in isolation, but loses to Elche in the three-way mini-league.",

PSG tops the group. Between Leipzig and United for 2nd place, their head-to-head is split (each won at home), but Leipzig has the crucial away goal advantage (scored 2 in Manchester vs United's 2 in Leipzig, but Leipzig's 3-2 home win gives them better overall head-to-head goal difference).",
